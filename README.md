This repository contains the full set of scripts and analysis materials developed for my research paper titled
**"Strategic Bidding and Spite in Combinatorial Clock Auctions: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis"**,
completed for the *ECO 395K: Economics of Auctions* course at the Department of Economics, University of Texas at Austin, in Fall 2024.

This project explores strategic behaviors in **Combinatorial Clock Auctions (CCA)**, with a particular focus on *spiteful bidding*—a behavior where firms not only aim to win but also actively seek to raise their rivals' costs. The paper introduces a formal utility model with a spitefulness parameter and extends classical GARP tests to empirically identify such behaviors in real-world auctions.

Using data from **FCC Auction 107**, the study provides empirical evidence of widespread deviations from truth-telling, including demand expansion at rising prices. The estimated spitefulness coefficient of certain bidders (e.g., T-Mobile License LLC) supports the hypothesis that CCAs enable and even encourage strategic distortions away from efficient outcomes.

All scripts and data processing routines are made publicly available to support transparency, replication, and further research. If this repository is helpful for your work, I’d be grateful for an acknowledgment or citation.

For any inquiries, collaboration ideas, or research-related opportunities, feel free to reach out. I am currently seeking research-oriented positions and would be grateful for any relevant connections.
